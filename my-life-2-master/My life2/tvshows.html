</head>
<body>
<p>Some of my favorite TV Shows are Modern Family and How I met your mother. They are just fun to watch and gets me relaxed when I watch these two shows. </p>
<p>Seven seasons in, Modern Family is the type of show where you ultimately know exactly what you are going to get when you watch it. <br> It is a show with a rigid structure that serves it well.  Sometimes there are experimental episodes of Modern Family that attempt to challenge that, but mostly,<br>you get what you get, and the mark of a good episode of Modern Family depends on just how funny it can make the expected.</p>

<p>How I met Your Mother</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother, a series that was all <br>about how the journey turns you into the person who is ultimately worthy of love when the right person finally lands in your life.</p>
